# object_detection
This is with reference to the object_detection_using_tensorflow_forGPU by Edje Electronics, The reason I am publicizing this because I was also unable to work my path through the path errors  

Here in this object detection 
I have appended the paths and now there is no need to use protobuf or any other slim package path appender
This will help you detect customized objects in a video or an Image

This is only possible because of Edje Electronics
